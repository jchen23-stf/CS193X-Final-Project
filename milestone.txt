Overview
--------
I have built the first prototype of the landing page. That includes a header and a template post that I can use later. 
Here are my next steps:
[ ] Build a comment page where users can see comments in threads for each post 
[ ] Build the APIs for posting a new post, and getting feed
[ ] Build the User class and login system
